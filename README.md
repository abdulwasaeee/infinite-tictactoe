# Infinite Tic-Tac-Toe

Welcome to the **Infinite Tic-Tac-Toe** game! This project is a fun and interactive web-based version of the classic game, featuring multiple boards, player scores, and a simple user interface. The game allows players to compete by placing "X" and "O" on any of the six boards, with a unique scoreboard that keeps track of points.

## **Inspiration**

This is my first hackathon! I wanted to see how it feels to work on a project in a hackathon setting and build something fun. The idea came from wanting to create a unique twist on the traditional Tic-Tac-Toe game.

---

## **What It Does**

- **Infinite Tic-Tac-Toe** is a web-based multiplayer game where players alternate turns between "X" and "O".
- The game features **6 different boards**, each with 9 cells to play on, allowing for endless gameplay.
- The **scoreboard** tracks the score of Player 1 (X) and Player 2 (O), and it automatically resets the board when there is a winner.

---

## **How We Built It**

- This game was built using **React** for the frontend, leveraging its state management to keep track of multiple boards and players' turns.
- I utilized **ChatGPT** for guidance in implementing the game logic but added my own unique twist to make it my own.
- The styling was done using **CSS**, with a fun and playful design that mimics a football theme, with grass-like green tiles and a blue sky for the background.

---

## **Challenges We Ran Into**

- As this is my first hackathon, I had limited web development experience, so understanding how to handle React states and managing multiple boards was challenging.
- Debugging CSS and React components was a steep learning curve but ultimately rewarding.

---

## **Accomplishments That We're Proud Of**

- Successfully created an interactive and engaging web app from scratch.
- Managed to implement a scoreboard that updates based on the player's performance across multiple boards.
- Gained hands-on experience with React and CSS.

---

## **What We Learned**

- Hackathons can be challenging but incredibly fun and rewarding.
- React is a powerful framework for building interactive web apps, and CSS is crucial for making an app visually appealing.
- Collaboration, even with AI tools like ChatGPT, can provide a strong foundation for building apps quickly.

## **What's Next for Infinite-Tic-Tac-Toe**

- There are no immediate plans for updates, but it would be great if people actually play it! I may add additional features like:

  - Multiplayer support.
  - More complex game boards.
  - A leaderboard to track the highest scores.
